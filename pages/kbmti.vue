            KBMTI is one of the student organization at Brawijaya University.
            Every year, KBMTI redesigns the appearance of its website in line
            with the changes of its council. During the 2020 management period,
            I was responsible for providing visual direction of the website
            design.

            Through wireframes, we were able to workout some of the technical
            issues that would not be viable in the website. It was important for
            us to scale down so that we could work around the features that we
            really wanted to have, rather than working upwards and missing
            something that would've been really cool to see as a user.

            Using matching playful tones of color with calm and relaxing white
            and pastel colors, we were able to sell the identity of KBMTI as a
            clean, artsy, intuitive application. We also use the typeface
            Helvetica within the interface as they giving of matching the clean
            environment built in the website.

            This project is actually my first real UI design job. From this
            use-case I've learnt so much about creating interface which is not
            only looking good, but also give users sense of comfort. I also
            gained alot about how to communicate and translate what the users
            have in mind into a vivid visuals. At this project I felt like I
            have defined my style and design characteristics.
